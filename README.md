# Music-Player

# A music player developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to offer an engaging audio experience. The interface features a display for the current track's name and artist, along with intuitive playback controls, including options for play, pause, next, previous, and random or repeat modes. It incorporates volume and seek sliders to allow users to adjust audio settings easily. Additionally, tracks are loaded dynamically from a predefined list, and the background color changes randomly with each new track, adding a visually appealing element to the player.
